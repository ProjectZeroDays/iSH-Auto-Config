### Working on this currently, it's not ready for deployment. However, Feel free to contribute...

This is an automated configuration 
script that I created to (re)establish 
a fully updated, upgraded, and 
pre-configured development environment
 within iSH when things go wrong 
and your files disappear or you 
happen to break something internally
 beyond repair. I got a little tired 
of continually setting everything 
back up again. 

#### NOTE: 
    You can now backup your file system using the settings menu as descibed in the wiki:
